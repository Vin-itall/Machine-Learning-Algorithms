# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
- Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression are implemented from scratch in python on mnist 
  dataset of hand written digits to predict the digit as their corresponding labels using mean and standard
  deviation of each picture as features.
  
- K-means Clustering algorithm was implemented using two strategies,
  1. Selecting the intial centroids randsomly.
  2. Selecting the first centroid randomly and for every next centroid the point from the dataset that has the 
     maximum average distance from the previously selected centroids is chosen in way that the selected centroids
     don't repeat.
  The algorithm is tested on the data set of 2-D points "AllSamples.mat" present in the resources folder.
